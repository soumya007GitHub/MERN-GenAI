What is prompt engineering?
Ans - Prompt engineering is the process of crafting precise and effective prompts to guide generative AI models, like large language models (LLMs), in producing desired outputs.
      It's about designing inputs (prompts) that interact optimally with the AI model, helping it understand the task and generate accurate, relevant, and creative responses.
